# Signal_and_Systems_NTUA
Analytical exercises and projects in matlab language for the course signals and systems for the academic year 2020-2021 at NTUA University of Athens.
The matlab project is about both filter design and filter application to music signals.
The detailed exercises are mainly written in Greek. Unfortunately, I could not find the pronunciations of these exercises.
